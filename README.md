## 🧠 bfc++ - Advanced Brainfuck Interpreter
bfc++ is an enhanced Brainfuck interpreter that extends the original language with new features such as conditionals, variables, ASCII manipulation, and improved input handling. It provides a more flexible and structured approach while staying true to Brainfuck's minimalist nature.

## 🚀 Installation
Simply compile the source code using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ -o bfc++ src/*.cpp
```
Or use the precompiled binary if available.

## 📌 Usage
Run a Brainfuck script with:

```
bfc++ <script.bf>
```
Optional Flags:
* --debug → Show each execution step
* --sizem <size> → Set the memory size (default: 10)
* --help Get the mini doc in terminal

"-"	Decrease the value at the current memory cell
">"	Move memory pointer to the right
"<"	Move memory pointer to the left
"["	Start a loop (while current cell != 0)
"]"	End of the loop
"("	Start an if block (if current cell == 0)
")"	End of the if block
"."	Print ASCII character of current cell
":"	Print numeric ASCII value of current cell
","	Get a character from user input (stores its ASCII code)
";"	Get a number from user input (0-255)
"#"	Comment (ignores everything on the line)
"="	Set current cell to max value (255)
