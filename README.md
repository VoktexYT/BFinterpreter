## üß† bfc++ - Advanced Brainfuck Interpreter
bfc++ is an enhanced Brainfuck interpreter that extends the original language with new features such as conditionals, variables, ASCII manipulation, and improved input handling. It provides a more flexible and structured approach while staying true to Brainfuck's minimalist nature.

## üöÄ Installation
Simply compile the source code using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ -o bfc++ src/*.cpp
```
Or use the precompiled binary if available.

## üìå Usage
Run a Brainfuck script with:

```
bfc++ <script.bf>
```
Optional Flags:
* --debug ‚Üí Show each execution step
* --sizem <size> ‚Üí Set the memory size (default: 10)
* --help Get the mini doc in terminal

## üî§ Extended Brainfuck Syntax
Symbol	Description<br>
"+"	Increase the value at the current memory cell<br>
"-"	Decrease the value at the current memory cell<br>
">"	Move memory pointer to the right<br>
"<"	Move memory pointer to the left<br>
"["	Start a loop (while current cell != 0)<br>
"]"	End of the loop<br>
"("	Start an if block (if current cell == 0)<br>
")"	End of the if block<br>
"."	Print ASCII character of current cell<br>
":"	Print numeric ASCII value of current cell<br>
","	Get a character from user input (stores its ASCII code)<br>
";"	Get a number from user input (0-255)<br>
"#"	Comment (ignores everything on the line)<br>
"="	Set current cell to max value (255)<br>
"_"	Set current cell to min value (0)<br>
"/"	Convert a character to ASCII and store it (/a ‚Üí 97)<br>
"@"	Store current cell value in a variable<br>
"$"	Set current cell value to a stored variable<br><br>
